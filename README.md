## Overview
The Unified IIoT Stack Setup repository provides a simple and streamlined solution for setting up a comprehensive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) stack using Docker. This repository aims to simplify the installation process of popular IIoT components and serves as a starting point for beginners or anyone in need of a fast solution for installing and running the IIoT stack.

The IIoT stack includes the following components:

- **Mosquitto**: An open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol for efficient communication between devices in an IoT network.
- **Node-RED**: A flow-based programming tool that allows users to easily create IoT applications by wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services.
- **InfluxDB**: A high-performance time series database that is optimized for handling large volumes of timestamped data generated by IoT devices.
- **Grafana**: A powerful data visualization and analytics platform that provides real-time monitoring and visualization of IoT data.
- **Portainer**: An open-source container management GUI that simplifies the management and deployment of Docker containers.

Feel free to customize and extend the stack by adding other packages to suit your specific requirements.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
You can run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to avoid any problems of version incompatibilities. Other than that there is no prerequisites (Docker and Docker Compose are automatically installed by the setup script. No manual installation is required).

### Setup Steps
To set up the Unified IIoT Stack on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal `CTRL+ALT+T`.

2. Execute the following command to download and run the setup script:
    ```shell
    sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moemen-benhamad/unified-iiotstack-setup/main/setup.sh)"
    ```

3. Once the setup script has completed, the entire IIoT stack, including Mosquitto, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana, and Portainer, will be up and running and enabled on boot.

4. Access the different components of the IIoT stack using the following URLs:
   - Mosquitto: `mqtt://localhost:1883`
   - Node-RED: `http://localhost:1880`
   - InfluxDB: `http://localhost:8086`
   - Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Portainer: `http://localhost:9000`

5. Configure the different components.\
*ps: **portainer** configuration has to be done within the first 5 min of running the containers, if you missed this time window you can run the following command to reset the 5 min time window.*
```shell
sudo docker stop portainer && sudo docker start portainer
```
